## Day Two: Enhancing Projects and Building a Personal Site

Today was packed with activities focused on improving my existing projects and starting a new one. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:

### Nejo JSON Viewer Updates

- Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions
- Fixed a bug related to array list rendering
- Improved support and documentation for using the library with Next.js
- Released version 1.2.0 with these updates

### Job Market Research

I spent some time reading job offers on LinkedIn to get a better understanding of current market demands and expectations.

### Personal Website Development

I decided to create a personal website to showcase my skills and projects:

- Chose to use Next.js and deploy with Vercel for a modern, performant site
- Implemented the Nejo JSON Viewer to display my CV in a JSON format
- Registered a domain through NIC Argentina (nic.ar)
- Created an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the site
- Repository: [ivanhuay-site](https://github.com/ivanhuay/ivanhuay-site)

#### Future Plans for the Website
