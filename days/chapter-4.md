# From Zero to Hired: Crafting an AI-Powered Dev Blog Generator - Chapter 4

## Chapter 4: Turning Raw Notes into Polished Blog Posts

Today marked a significant leap in my journey from job seeker to innovator, as I embarked on creating a new AI project that could revolutionize how developers document their progress.

## Introduction

Inspired by the need for efficient dev blog creation, I conceived and began developing "Devblog-AI," a tool designed to transform raw notes into fully-fledged blog posts. This project not only showcases my skills but also explores the cutting edge of AI services in web development.

## Main Activities

### Updating Existing Projects
- Updated the Storybook build for nejo-json-viewer, enhancing its documentation and accessibility.
- Planned updates for Hiroki, my REST framework, after noticing changes in its basic project example.

### Developing Devblog-AI
1. **UI Creation with v0.dev**
   - Utilized Vercel's new AI-powered UI design tool.
   - Explored and implemented components from ui.shadcn.com.
   - Faced challenges with Tailwind CSS but embraced it for practice.

2. **Backend Development**
   - Integrated ChatGPT API for content generation.
   - Utilized Hiroki for rapid REST API development.
   - Implemented CRUD operations for notes management.
   - Integrated Antropic Claude API for content generation.


3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Connected the UI with backend APIs.
   - Implemented note creation, editing, and AI-powered blog post generation.

4. **Project Structuring**
   - Created a monorepo structure for better project management.
   - Set up Docker and docker-compose for easy deployment and development.

## Reflections

Today's work on Devblog-AI has been both challenging and rewarding. It's fascinating to see how AI tools like v0.dev can accelerate UI development, though it requires adapting to new styling paradigms like Tailwind CSS. The integration of ChatGPT and Claude for content generation opens up exciting possibilities for automating creative tasks.

## Next Steps

- Enhance Devblog-AI's UI and improve API functionality.
- Implement comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend.
- Continue refining the AI-generated content quality.
- Use Devblog-AI to document my ongoing job search and development journey.

## Day Summary

- Updated nejo-json-viewer with new Storybook build
- Conceptualized and began development of Devblog-AI
- Created a functional UI using v0.dev and ui.shadcn.com
- Developed backend with ChatGPT and Claude integration using Hiroki
- Set up a monorepo structure with Docker for easy deployment
- Successfully integrated frontend and backend components

## Closing

As I continue my journey from job seeker to employed developer, projects like Devblog-AI not only enhance my portfolio but also push the boundaries of what's possible with AI in web development. Each day brings new challenges and learning opportunities, propelling me closer to my goal of securing an exciting new role in tech.
